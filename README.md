### About

The [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package `LoopIntegrals` is an ongoing work to compute master integrals using commutative and noncommutative methods from computational algebraic geometry.

The package is based on several packages from the [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project), all of which are distributed with [recent versions of GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/Releases/index.html). To run the examples you need at least the package versions required on the [download page](https://homalg-project.github.io/LoopIntegrals/), which might be newer than the ones [distributed with GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html).

Future versions may depend on [more packages](https://github.com/homalg-project/LoopIntegrals/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L12), especially those from or relying on the [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project) for computational category theory and homological algebra.

The most recent versions of all packages can be cloned or downloaded from the [homalg/CAP repositories page](https://github.com/homalg-project).
